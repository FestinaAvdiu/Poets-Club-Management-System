# The Poets Club Management System üìö 

## Description

The Poets Club Management System is a console-based application in C language, designed to manage a database of poetry club members. It allows you to track their performance, promote members based on their participation, and perform various management tasks.

**üéâ Fun Fact:** This was my very first programming project! 

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to create a tool that can:
- Access and manage a database of poetry club members.
- Keep track of their performance.
- Determine which members qualify for promotion based on their participation.
- Provide options to manage members, including adding, searching, promoting, and saving changes.

## Project Structure

The project is separated into the following files:

- **`main.c`**: Contains the main logic and user interface for the program.
- **`functions.c`**: Contains the implementation of various functions used in the program.
- **`functions.h`**: Header file that declares functions and includes necessary libraries.
- **`database.txt`**: A text file used to store member data.

## üåü Features

The program provides the following features:

- Check the number of members on the list.
  
- Allocate memory for the structure array.
  
- Read data from the database file into the structure array.

- Display five options to the user:

    üìú Print the list of members.

    ‚ûï Add a new club member to the list.

    üîç Search for a member by ID.

    üåü Promote a member.

    üíæ Save all changes and quit.
    
- Allow the user to continue or quit based on their input.
  
- Only promote members who have been part of the club for at least 1.5 years and have a ‚ÄúParticipant‚Äù role.
  
- Changes are saved to the text file only when option 5 (Save changes) is selected.
